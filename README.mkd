# tsh -- quick and easy testing shell

Pre-rendered online documentation is [here](http://sitaramc.github.com/tsh).

Simple examples
[here](http://sitaramc.github.com/tsh/doc/tsh-examples.sh.html).

The test program for 'gitpod' is TAP compliant and can be found
[here](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitpod/blob/master/t/t01).  A syntax
colored version is
[here](http://sitaramc.github.com/tsh/doc/gitpod-test.html).

Although gitolite has too many tests for me to convert all of them, all new
tests will use tsh.  [Here](http://sitaramc.github.com/tsh/doc/gl-t12.html) is
the only one that was born after tsh came into being.
